                                I had joined SRIMCA in my MCA 2nd Year; Well when I got mail for "Alumni Speaks" I really felt its very great idea to share my experience with SRIMCA & current designation.
                          <br><br>
                                The imperial MCA has been for me an â€śacceleratorâ€ť of work and life experience. You will be part of a multicultural group of people coming from all over the world, with different ways of thinking and work experience. My advice is to embrace these differences and appreciate them all in every day, class and assignment â€“ Have clear goals before you start the MCA and be open minded to challenge your beliefs. The MCA is an opportunity for me to change and grow.
                         <br><br>
                         I still remember those days when we used to feel bad after getting scolded in presentation or getting our submission rejected by the faculty members. But now, when we get a pat on our back from our managers, saying that 'Hey man you have done a great job, you really have great oral and written communicational skillsâ€™; that really reminds us the pain that our faculty members took to make sure that we, the SRIMCAins, became perfect in technical and communicational skills.
                         <br><br>
                         "Greatminds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people."

                        "Never let your life sinks this low, forget what others are focusing on, and be dedicated to your craft with everything that is inside of you. Remember that life isn't a popularity contest, and that you aren't here to compete with others as much as you are here to compete with yourself."

                            "When I cleared the MCA entrance exam, my first choice was Surat, but due to small margin I didn't get the preferred location. Then as per my second choice I took admission in SRIMCA. I was only aware that there was a new college is open a year back who is offering courses like BCA, MCA, B.Pharm etc. When I took admission in SRIMCA that time I thought for a day college is in under construction... how do I study in this new college and then I thought again, I came here for completing my degree not for seeing building. But within in 3 years college infrastructure was so beautiful and full of facilities. When my classes started in 1st year one by one lecturers came and taken their lectures, I completely shock to saw the way of teaching. The way mode of teaching was excellent, understandable and so beautiful. I never remembered that I have faced any problem in my college life regarding theory, practical, projects, etc. I heard from my friends which were in other college started in 2003. They said they are not regular in their college, because their lectures are not taken regularly. They were enjoying their life by bunking there classes. But here I say that I was never absent in my college life because I don't wanted to miss my single lecture and college life enjoyment. I feel glad to become a part of SRIMCA."

                        "My biggest achievement is work as a GENERAL SECRETARY of college. It's a very respectable thing for me which is meaningless without SRIMCA. That leadership is helping to perform my day to day activity as project leader."

It's my honor to appreciate the expertise of all the faculties to motivate us to have a thorough understanding of each and every concept. I am fortunate to be driven positively towards goal achievement by our respected Director Dr. Bankim Patel Sir. I heartily express my sincere gratitude towards the three pioneers of this great institution Dr. Ateet Mehta Sir, Dr. Chintan Naik Sir and Dr. Kalpesh Lad Sir. I realized today that the Specialization concept initiated by Dr. Bankim Sir has been very much helpful to us towards our keen focus in selection of our domain. We groomed entirely in the strict but supporting environment of SRIMCA family.
